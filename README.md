# melikechan's Setup

The repository is about my computer setup. I decided to create a repository about my setup because I usually get confused about what to install/what to use after a clear installation, so better to create a list about it.

**Note: The repository is currently a draft, will be edited and refactored.**

## My OS/Distro

- I use Linux as my primary and only OS.
- My distro is Arch Linux. Sometimes I think about building my custom one Linux From Scratch but I don't have time for now.

### Shell

- I use zsh with [powerlevel-10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

My dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/melikechan/dotfiles) (not uploaded yet)

### DE/WM

- I usually use GNOME as my DE and its built-in WM, Mutter.
- I sometimes use i3-gaps + GNOME too.

#### GNOME Setup

##### Themes

I am thinking of making my own theme, called as "Advance" with dark variation. But I currently use:

- [Nordic](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/) (bluish accent) as main theme.
- Adwaita for cursors and icons.

##### Extensions

- [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)
- [Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/)
- [Dash to Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/)
