# GNOME Setup

That was the setup while I was using GNOME. I switched into i3 completely at **10.03.2023**.

## Theme(s)

I was thinking of making my own theme, called as "Advance" with dark variation. But I currently use:

- [Nordic](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/) (bluish accent) as main theme.
- Adwaita for cursors and icons.

## Extensions

- [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)
